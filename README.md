# Fraud_Report_Block_Sim_Sms_service
This is a demo project, that proposes to solve the issue of delayed intervention after a sim swap. The users can opt to use the new SMS service to temporarily block their SIM card and prevent any further losses from a fraudulent SIM swap. The users can also use the new proposed  IVR self-help menu on *100#.

Powered by Flask and Africastalking sms API.

The project is currently under development..... stay tuned!
